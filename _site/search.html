        "content": "A lot of people donât have the means to rent or to put their possessions into storage while they search for a new home; using a contingency contract allows them to move from one property to another without making a double move.In todayâs second installment in my series on contingency contracts, Iâll show you how to prepare your home if youâre considering going through with this âdomino dealâ (click here to see my video on home staging):If youâre going to navigate the marketplace as a seller with a contingency contract, itâs almost mandatory that you put your home in its best light. Youâll need to price your home correctly per its market value, or perhaps even a little below. That way, you can get your property under contract with a buyer as quickly as possible and a higher chance of the seller accepting your offer.âNever reschedule buyers when they ask to view your home; let them come as they deem fit.âTo position your home in the market properly, youâll also need to do more than price it correctly and stage itâyouâll also need to have a very, very flexible schedule for showings. Never reschedule buyers when they ask to view your home; let them come as they deem fit. Youâre trying to generate an offer quickly so that you can get to the next one, and delaying their visits will not only extend the time period in which you need to sell your home, but it may also cause buyers to pursue other options.When you do find a home that you love, youâll also need to structure your offer depending on its price point. If youâre shopping in, say, the $275,000-or-below range and the home you find is in good condition, youâll probably find some competition in the form of multiple-offer situations. Since youâre a contingency buyer, youâll need to put your best foot forward to have the seller even consider your offer. Youâll have a harder time in a multiple-offer situation if you donât have a buyer for your current home by the time you place an offer on the home youâre attempting to purchase.In my next video, Iâll discuss more about how to structure an offer so that yours wins out amidst a crowd of competing buyers.I hope you found this information valuable! If you have any questions or comments about contingency contracts, feel free to reach out to me. Â Iâm always available for you.",

There are many sellers with contingency contracts trying to locate properties in the $250,000-and-below range, and the majority of them have to compete in multiple-offer situations against non-contingent offers.âIf you donât want to do a double-move or you donât have the time or resources to move into a temporary rental, you need to know how to navigate the contingency contract.âThis is why Iâm starting a series dedicated to the ins and outs of the contingency contractâto teach you how to present this type of offer in its best light so that you sell your first home for top dollar and purchase your next one without needing to do the double-move.Â The first video will explain how to position your current home on the market successfully. After that, weâll talk about how you can make your best offer possible. So stay tuned to learn everything you need to know about this topic.Â If you have any questions or any other real estate needs I can take care of, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Iâve been selling real estate for over 25 years and in that time, Iâve learned many tips and tricks about how to get homes sold for top dollar with the least amount of inconvenience to our sellers. I went and researched home staging, and found that a survey of 4,500 homes that were staged said that 68% of them sold for at least 9% more than a non-staged neighborâs.I truly believe the difference can come down to staging when it comes to selling for top dollar. However, I donât think you need to spend thousands or even hundreds with a professional home stager. They do a fantastic job, but I think soft staging your home with your own things can be successful as well.âSoft staging is the way to go.âSoft staging can make a huge difference in the way your home is perceived. All you really need to do is declutter, depersonalize, pay attention to the details and the lighting, and that can change the ambience of your home drastically. When agents are showing homes, they could be showing anywhere from three to five a day, so they donât have time to stage it themselves.Â To prepare your home to put it on the market, I think that soft staging is the way to go. Perception becomes reality. Organize your closet and your garage and that will go a long way.You donât have to be an organized person to do this. As long as your home is organized while youâre showing it, buyers will pay more money because they get the perception that your home is well-maintained.I hope you found this information on staging helpful. If you have any questions for me or need any help staging your own property before you list it on the market, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Â ",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâm delighted to be joined by Tom Bartosh with Prime West Mortgage to talk a little bit about the lending world.Â Iâve been working with Tom for probably about six years now. Heâs one of our preferred lenders for a reason. He has closed every transaction on time, every time. Not only does that show heâs on top of the ball, but it also shows that heâs a joy to work with.Tom has been in the business since 1987. He loves what he does. He loves helping people through the mortgage process, and he loves to see closings. He makes the whole process fun.âIf Tom sends me a pre-approval letter for a buyer, I know that it is golden.âHow is he able to close on time, every time? It all starts off with his loan application process. Itâs a thorough document that takes into account the entire picture of the buyer. Heâs also an expert in all of the different loan programs that are available out there.Â If Tom sends me a pre-approval letter for a buyer, I know that it is golden. Now the ball is in my court to find them the best possible home, and theyâll take over from there. Oftentimes, Tom and his team are ready to close early, which is always a fantastic surprise.Right now, Tom has a lot of different loan programs available for first-time homebuyers. There are grants, low down payment options, and much more. There are about five different programs that Tom has been utilizing. Tom loves working with first-time buyers and seeing the look on their faces at the end when their home closes.Although Tom is an expert himself, he couldnât do what he does without his team. His loan processor, Tammy, has been working with him for 25 years and is an integral part of his process.If you have any questions for Tom or youâre curious about what kind of home you can afford, give him a call at (972) 935-9200 or send him an email to tbartosh@primewestcorp.com.If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Â ",

        "content": "The market is beginning to heat up in Ellis County, and recent data definitely reflects this.For one thing, inventory remains low. With just 2.6 monthsâ worth of homes available on the market, sellers are in a prime position to sell quickly and for top dollar. Even at this comparatively low level of inventory, though, buyers are beginning to gain some leverage. The number of available listings has risen since last year, while the total number of closed home sales is actually down.âTake advantage of these market conditions while they last.âAlso, while the average sales price has gone up since 2018, the list-to-sales price ratio has dropped. This, in conjunction with the fact that listings are taking longer to sell, indicates that sellers now need to be more flexible if they want to strike a deal.Â The bottom line is to take advantage of these market conditions while they last. Weâve hit the peak of the real estate cycle, so donât delay.Â If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious about how I can help you make the most of your real estate goals, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email.

        "content": "One of our frequently most asked questions is, âHow do we hire you as a real estate agent and how does that relationship work?â Therefore, weâre diving into agency relationships today. Here are the three most common relationships that people have with a real estate agent:1. The listing agent. This person represents the best interest of the homeowner only. They market the home for sale, schedule showings.âAn intermediary transaction can be the easiest, most seamless transaction possible.â2. The buyerâs agent. This person represented the best interests of the buyer only. They can advise you on how to make offers, where to find homes, and help you get the best terms possible.3. Intermediary. This person represents both a buyer and seller in a transaction as long as both parties are consenting. It has to be a written agreement and sometimes these can be the easiest, most seamless transactions. In our brokerage, an intermediary is chosen for each side of the transaction. We will make sure the transaction is done correctly and without a lot of hassle.Iâm happy to be able to answer this question today and Iâm always happy to answer any more of them that you have.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What can buyers and sellers expect from the rest of our 2019 market here in Ellis County and in the DFW Metro area?First, letâs look at the current market statistics in Ellis County. We have 2.5 months of inventory, which means weâre still in a strong sellerâs market. However, the tide is starting to turn in favor of buyers. This means if youâre a seller and youâve been sitting on the fence, now is the time to capitalize on current conditions.Â Furthermore, the average days on market is 60 days, and the list-to-sale price ratio is 96% (for our clients, though, the average list-to-sale price ratio is 99%). Iâve been selling real estate for over 25 years, and this has been one of the craziest markets Iâve ever seen. What I love about it is buyers have been able to buy homes at top dollar and then sell them later for an additional profitâeven with Realtor fees.âIâve been selling real estate for over 25 years, and this has been one of the craziest markets Iâve ever seen.âNow, in terms of our broader DFW Metro market, there are four trends buyers and sellers need to be aware of in 2019, according to Realtor.com:  More homes on the market. Additionally, luxury homes will stay on the market longer, which means sellers in the higher price ranges will need to be more creative to get their home sold in a timely manner. Â   Shrinking affordability. Weâve seen a ton of economic growth in the DFW metroplex recently, but moving forward, affordability will become an issue for buyers, especially in the $250,000-and-under price range. When you combine this trend with rising interest rates, first-time buyers run the risk of getting priced out of the market.Â   Changes in buyer demographics. Last year, 45% of all homebuyers were millennials (Gen Xers made up 36%, and baby boomers accounted for 17%). The buyers who will really be able to capitalize on the 2019 market are move-up buyers, because theyâll be able to use the equity theyâve built up as their current homes have appreciated and roll that equity into their next homes.Â   The new tax law. Obviously we wonât know the full extent of this lawâs impact until after April 15, but itâs still something to keep an eye on in terms of what kind of mortgage deductions you can make.Â Overall, our market is still performing well. If youâre a seller, as I said, thereâs no better time to enter the market than right now. If youâre a buyer, Iâd advise you to jump into the market as well. Interest rates are climbing, but theyâve stalled a bit recently and are hovering around 4.375%, which is still historically low.Â Whether youâre buying or selling, donât hesitate to give my team a call so we can help you accomplish all of your real estate goals.
