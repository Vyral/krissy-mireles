It’s been one heck of a hot summer, and things are getting ready to cool off. If buying a home is in your future, I have some great tips for you. **Specifically, here are the four best things about buying a home in the fall:**

**1\. Less competition.** There may not be fewer homes on the market, but there is definitely a slowdown. With less competition, you may be able to negotiate a great deal.

**2\. Sellers are serious.** When people throw their homes on the market in the fall, it’s usually for a reason. Maybe they have built a new home or decided to relocate. Either way, sellers are serious in the fall.

**3\. You can be the center of attention.** The reason I say this is because the busiest times of the market are in spring and summer. Everyone’s busy. By fall time, things start to cool off and you may be able to get yourself some super attention from buyers.

**4\. You can get a good deal on new construction.** If you’re looking for a brand-new home specifically, you can take advantage of some great incentives and year-end sales, allowing you to get a nice discount on a brand-new home.&nbsp;

Consumer Reports says that September is a great time for buying carpet and paint, October is a great time to buy a lawnmower, and that appliances and cookware are their cheapest in November.

If you have any questions for me about this list or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
