*We’re doing things differently right now in regards to helping our clients buy and sell homes. Here are some of the changes we’ve made during these uncertain times.*

If you’re in the real estate marketplace as a buyer or seller right now, I want you to know that **our team will start doing things differently in order to help as many buyers and sellers as we can navigate through real estate transactions during this time.**

Washing hands and social distancing is the name of the game, so here’s what we’ll do: If you’re a buyer who needs to buy but are nervous about becoming exposed, we will FaceTime you to show you the property, take video tours if needed, and make sure you have all the information you necessary to make an informed decision.&nbsp;

If you’re currently in the process of selling your home, we can get it listed and sold without having anyone come inside. With the technology we have today, we can easily navigate you through a home sale. We’re going to use video conferencing, staging, and your cell phone to make sure your home appeals to buyers online.

**What I want to leave you with is this: Have faith, not fear.** Of course, we need to be doing all we possibly can to protect our families and stop the spread, but we’re going to continue to help buyers and sellers get the job done.

I’m currently in the process of buying an investment home, and I can help you with that, too. If you have questions about the precautions we’re taking in this market or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
