<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why investing in real estate now can help you enjoy life later on.</em></p>

If you’re also on that page, then it becomes important to build wealth and create residual income for yourself. Real estate is a great vehicle to have some mailbox money coming in. You can pick up some rental properties (ensuring, of course, that you’re positive cash-flowing on those rental rates) so that **you can have monthly income to help you get out of the rat race.**&nbsp;
