Here’s an exciting opportunity for the right motivated homebuyer.

Are you a homebuyer out in this market who’s frustrated with the loan qualification process, or your credit score isn’t quite where it needs to be? If so, you need to contact us today. We can help you out.

Our team has recently partnered with a company that can help folks that do not qualify for a loan at this moment in time purchase their dream home. They can help you get into a property of your choice.

They will let you pick the property, buy it for you in cash, and then rent it from them until you’re qualified to buy the home yourself. You do have to go through a qualifying process, but it’s not credit-driven like traditional loan qualifications.&nbsp;

If you’ve been struggling with qualifying to buy a home but you’re committed to doing so, we’d love to connect you. Give us a call or send us an email today and we’ll get everything set up. We’d love to hear from you if you have any real estate questions as well.<br>&nbsp;
