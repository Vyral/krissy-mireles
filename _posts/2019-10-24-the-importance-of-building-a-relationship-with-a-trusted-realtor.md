As a homebuyer going through the beginning stages of the home buying process, you’re much better off directing any questions or concerns to your own personal Realtor instead of calling one of those popular real estate platforms like Zillow.&nbsp;

Why? **Realtors on these platforms pay for leads.** They pay for every single call that comes via these websites—that’s who you’re getting connected to when you call those hotlines, and they will try to work with you. If you have a trusted agent by your side, they’ll be the one representing you anyway, so why not just get your information from them?

Over time, even if you’re not thinking about buying or selling real estate, I’m sure you still have questions about how the market is performing, or whether it’s a good idea to invest in real estate, or whether it’s a good idea to paint your front door lime green. You need to have your own Realtor so you can call them on a whim and get answers. Your trusted Realtor wants to be your trusted Realtor for life. We want you to feel comfortable calling us with your questions (by the way, lime green isn’t bad—it just depends on where you live).&nbsp;

Aside from getting answers to your questions and concerns, **building a relationship with a trusted Realtor will also help you to gain valuable insight on how to handle your biggest financial asset.&nbsp;**
