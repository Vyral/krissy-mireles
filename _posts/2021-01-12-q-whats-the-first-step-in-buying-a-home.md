<center><em>Here&rsquo;s the first thing you should do as a first-time homebuyer.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Here at the Krissy Mireles Team, we pride ourselves on working with first-time homebuyers, and we do things a bit differently than other real estate teams in this regard.&nbsp;

I know that we’re in a fast-paced market, but **if you’re a first-time homebuyer, I’d like you to take a step back for a second and invite you to schedule a first-time homebuyer consultation with me**. This benefits you because you should be informed and capable of making decisions for yourself and your family throughout the home buying process. How do you do that? By getting information.&nbsp;

If you sit down with me at my office, we’ll go over a myriad of information. Not only that, but I’ll show you what a contract looks like. I want you to be familiar with it so that when we actually prepare an offer, you feel comfortable and confident throughout the rest of the home buying process.&nbsp;

There’s nothing like working with an agent who doesn’t tell you what to expect when buying a home. Once you make an offer, you’ll get bombarded with information you don’t know how to respond to. What happens then is you’ll likely get overwhelmed and decide now’s not the right time to buy. We want to ensure this never happens to you and that you make the decisions you need to make when buying a home. Our real estate market is so fast-moving that it doesn’t give you much time to think during a transaction. You have to make decisions quickly.&nbsp;

Interest rates are still historically low in our market, so now’s the time to take advantage. **If you give me a call, my team and I will take you to the finish line.**&nbsp;As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.
