*UV light has been proven by scientists to be highly effective at killing germs. Our friends at Kirk AC want to help you add UV light to your current HVAC system.*

I’m hunkered down right now just like all of you, but today I wanted to talk to you about UV light and why you should add it to your HVAC system right this second. If you’re at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and seeking every advantage possible to help protect yourself, UV light may be a good solution. According to [Lincoln Tech,](https://www.lincolntech.edu/news/skilled-trades/hvac/separating-fact-from-myth-on-hvac-uv-light-benefits) broad-spectrum UV light has the capacity to kill microbes and won’t damage living human cells. It also has the ability to kill small viruses and bacteria in the air, in your body, and on your surfaces. [Kirk AC](https://kirkairconditioning.us/) is a family-owned business in downtown Dallas that specializes in adding a UV air purification system to your existing HVAC system.
