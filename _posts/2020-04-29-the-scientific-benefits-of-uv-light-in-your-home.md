I’m hunkered down right now just like all of you, but today I wanted to talk to you about UV light and why you should add it to your HVAC system right this second. If you’re at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and seeking every advantage possible to help protect yourself, UV light may be a good solution. According to [Lincoln Tech,](https://www.lincolntech.edu/news/skilled-trades/hvac/separating-fact-from-myth-on-hvac-uv-light-benefits) broad-spectrum UV light has the capacity to kill microbes and won’t damage living human cells. It also has the ability to kill small viruses and bacteria in the air, in your body, and on your surfaces. In a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC93076/) in the Applied and Environmental Microbiology journal by the American Society for Microbiology, fungal levels following UV operation were significantly lower than the levels in control air-handling units. [Kirk AC](https://kirkairconditioning.us/) is a family-owned business in downtown Dallas that specializes in adding a UV air purification system to your existing HVAC system.
