*Today I’m discussing the importance of having an inventory of all the items in your home in case of disaster or crime.*

Today I want to discuss the importance of having an inventory of everything in your home. The reason why I chose this subject now is that it’s the start of a new year.

I want to make sure you’re protecting yourself so that if something happens, your life has been made a little easier. Also, in case of disaster or flooding, having an inventory of your property is critical.

You should walk around your home and film each room, and take pictures of the serial numbers of all the big-ticket items in your house. Your cell phone is the perfect tool to use. Then simply upload the videos and photos to a secure place like iCloud. If something unfortunate happens, this will be one less thing to worry about. You’ll be glad you did it.&nbsp;
