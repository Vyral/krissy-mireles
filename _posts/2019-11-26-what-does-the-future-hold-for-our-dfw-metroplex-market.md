Now that 2019 is almost behind us, it’s time to take a look at what’s on the horizon. **Coming up in the near future, Dr. Mark Dotzour will be hosting the annual Old Republic Title’s Economic Forecast.** My team and I have had the pleasure of attending for several years, and, if you’re a Realtor, you need to go, too.&nbsp;

Not only is this event incredibly informative, but it’s also exceptionally funny. Dr. Dotzour has a great stage presence, and manages to make every subject he covers exciting and fun to hear about. I especially love hearing him speak about the consumer confidence index—the measure of how apt local consumers are to keep spending over time.&nbsp;

If you aren’t able to attend, though, allow me to give you a brief preview of what Dr. Dotzour is planning to touch on.

First of all, all signs point to 2020 being a great year for local real estate and the local DFW Metroplex economy.&nbsp;

**Prices are expected to continue to rise over the year ahead, though, so anyone thinking of buying soon should take advantage right now,** while it’s still affordable to do so. The bottom line is that, whatever your real estate goals may be, my team and I are here to help you make the most of them. We are always here for you and are so thankful for your support.&nbsp;

Speaking of giving thanks, **we hope you and your loved ones have a very happy Thanksgiving.** We can’t overstate our gratitude for you this year (and always). I hope your Turkey Day, and your entire holiday season, is full of food, family, and fun.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information about anything I’ve talked about in this message, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
