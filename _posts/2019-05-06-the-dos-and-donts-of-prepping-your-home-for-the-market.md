As a seller this spring, there are a few do’s and don’ts to be aware of if you’re prepping your home to sell quickly and for top dollar in our real estate market.&nbsp;

**For your convenience, I’ve timestamped all the do’s and don’ts you need to remember from the video above so you can skip ahead at your leisure. In each section, I’ll also explain why each one qualifies as a “do” or “don’t”:**

0:47—Do: focus on curb appeal projects<br>2:19—Do: make bathroom updates&nbsp;<br>2:51—Do: install new windows&nbsp;<br>3:40—Don’t: pay for extensive professional landscaping&nbsp;<br>4:06—Don’t: install a new roof, gutters, sprinklers, or HVAC unit<br>5:12—Don’t: add a swimming pool and/or personal spa&nbsp;<br>5:42—Don’t: paint the house<br>6:10—Don’t: install solar panels&nbsp;
