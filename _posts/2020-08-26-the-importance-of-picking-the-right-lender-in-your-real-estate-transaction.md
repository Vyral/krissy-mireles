<p style="text-align:center;">Now more than ever, it’s critical that you pick the right lender for your real estate transaction.</p>

I’m a listing agent, meaning that buyers and their agents come to me with lenders from all over the place, including local lenders, out-of-state lenders, and companies like QuickenLoans. As a seller’s agent, it’s important to not only look at the offers submitted to my clients but to also vet their lenders.

If there was anything that I could change about the real estate industry, it’d be the way the lending process is handled. Things are often done at the last minute, and though I know why the lenders do that, it would be a real boon if more lenders had their packages clear to close and ready to get to the finish line a couple of days in advance as opposed to trying to push those right before the closing date. When people don’t make it, lenders don’t make it.

If you’re working with a Realtor and they recommend three to five lenders, **please listen to your Realtor’s reasoning behind their recommendations.** They’ve probably built up relationships with these lenders, and if they’re giving the lenders decent business, the lender will want to make sure that their Realtor client is well taken care of, along with the borrower.

On the Krissy Mireles Team, **we surround ourselves with a myriad of lenders who are winners.** These are companies who have been in the lending industry for over 30 years; they know how to package loans and get their clients to the finish line—plus, they’re ready to close days in advance. Not many lenders can say that.

In the end, **make sure to vet your loan officers by asking them the right questions.** Ask them about their success rates, how quickly they close loans, how often their closes are delayed, and where you can find testimonials from other clients. Knowing the answers to these questions can make all the difference when it comes to closing on time.

If you’re looking for a good lender yourself or have any questions about the real estate process, please reach out to us. We’d be more than happy to provide you with a list of lenders who are known for closing promptly. Hope to hear from you soon\!
