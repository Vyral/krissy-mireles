<p style="text-align:center"><em>Here’s what the rise in cash homebuyers means for you.</em></p>

As a team that handles a lot of volume, we’re negotiating deals every day and have a pretty good feel for the market. One trend that has been sticking out, as of lately, is that there are a lot of cash buyers out there. **These aren’t just cash investors.** These are people who are using their hard-earned money and putting it into real estate.

Last weekend, my team was up against multiple offers on every single offer that they submitted. I was working with four different buyers, and every single one was in a multiple-offer situation.&nbsp;

**These cash buyers are really bringing it, as in they’re bidding list price or more to win these properties.** This makes things much more competitive for the rest of us.&nbsp;

If you’re a homebuyer with financing, it’s going to be tough to compete with a cash buyer who doesn’t have any contingencies. This means that you need to put your best foot forward on every single offer. Especially in the price point from $200,000 to $500,000. **It’s a fast and furious seller’s market.**

If you have any questions about buying a home, selling a home, or investing in real estate yourself, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
