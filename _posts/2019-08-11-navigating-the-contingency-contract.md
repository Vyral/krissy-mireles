You're ready to put your home on the market and make a move, but you need the proceeds from your sale to go toward your next home purchase.&nbsp;

If you don’t want to do a double-move or you don’t have the time or resources to move into a temporary rental, **you need to know how to navigate the contingency contract.&nbsp;**

I can tell you from experience that, depending on your price range, contingency contracts can be super stressful. There are many sellers with contingency contracts trying to locate properties in the $250,000-and-below range, and the majority of them have to compete in multiple-offer situations against non-contingent offers.

**This is why I’m starting a series dedicated to the ins and outs of the contingency contract**—to teach you how to present this type of offer in its best light so that you sell your first home for top dollar and purchase your next one without needing to do the double-move.&nbsp;

The first video will explain how to position your current home on the market successfully. After that, we’ll talk about how you can make your best offer possible. So stay tuned to learn everything you need to know about this topic.&nbsp;
