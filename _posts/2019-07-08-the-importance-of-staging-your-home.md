I’ve been selling real estate for over 25 years and in that time, I’ve learned many tips and tricks about how to get homes sold for top dollar with the least amount of inconvenience to our sellers. I went and researched home staging, and **found that a survey of 4,500 homes that were staged said that 68% of them sold for at least 9% more than a non-staged neighbor’s.**

I truly believe the difference can come down to staging when it comes to selling for top dollar. However, **I don’t think you need to spend thousands or even hundreds with a professional home stager.** They do a fantastic job, but I think soft staging your home with your own things can be successful as well.

Soft staging can make a huge difference in the way your home is perceived. All you really need to do is declutter, depersonalize, pay attention to the details and the lighting, and that can change the ambience of your home drastically. When agents are showing homes, they could be showing anywhere from three to five a day, so they don’t have time to stage it themselves.&nbsp;**To prepare your home to put it on the market, I think that soft staging is the way to go.** Perception becomes reality. Organize your closet and your garage and that will go a long way.

You don’t have to be an organized person to do this. **As long as your home is organized while you’re showing it, buyers will pay more money** because they get the perception that your home is well-maintained.

I hope you found this information on staging helpful. If you have any questions for me or need any help staging your own property before you list it on the market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
