Today I’m delighted to be joined by Tom Bartosh with Prime West Mortgage to talk a little bit about the lending world.&nbsp;

I’ve been working with Tom for probably about six years now. He’s one of our preferred lenders for a reason. **He has closed every transaction on time, every time.** Not only does that show he’s on top of the ball, but it also shows that he’s a joy to work with.

Tom has been in the business since 1987. He loves what he does. He loves helping people through the mortgage process, and he loves to see closings. He makes the whole process fun.

How is he able to close on time, every time? **It all starts off with his loan application process.** It’s a thorough document that takes into account the entire picture of the buyer. He’s also an expert in all of the different loan programs that are available out there.&nbsp;

If Tom sends me a pre-approval letter for a buyer, I know that it is golden. Now the ball is in my court to find them the best possible home, and they’ll take over from there. **Oftentimes, Tom and his team are ready to close early, which is always a fantastic surprise.**

Right now, Tom has a lot of different loan programs available for first-time homebuyers. There are grants, low down payment options, and much more. There are about five different programs that Tom has been utilizing. Tom loves working with first-time buyers and seeing the look on their faces at the end when their home closes.

**Although Tom is an expert himself, he couldn’t do what he does without his team.** His loan officer, Tammy, has been working with him for 25 years and is an integral part of his process.

If you have any questions for Tom or you’re curious about what kind of home you can afford, give him a call at (972) 935-9200 or send him an email to <u><strong><a href="mailto:tbartosh@primewestcorp.com">tbartosh@primewestcorp.com</a></strong></u>.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
