One of our frequently most asked questions is, **“How do we hire you as a real estate agent and how does that relationship work?”** Therefore, we’re diving into agency relationships today. Here are the three most common relationships that people have with a real estate agent:

**1\. The listing agent.** This person represents the best interest of the homeowner only. They market the home for sale, schedule showings.

**2\. The buyer’s agent.** This person represented the best interests of the buyer only. They can advise you on how to make offers, where to find homes, and help you get the best terms possible.

**3\. Intermediary.** This person represents both a buyer and seller in a transaction as long as both parties are consenting. It has to be a written agreement and sometimes these can be the easiest, most seamless transactions. In our brokerage, an intermediary is chosen for each side of the transaction. We will make sure the transaction is done correctly and without a lot of hassle.

I’m happy to be able to answer this question today and I’m always happy to answer any more of them that you have. Just give me a call or send me an email any time. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
